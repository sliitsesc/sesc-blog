SLIITXtreme 3.0, a coding competition organized by the IEEE Computer Society of SLIIT in collaboration with the Software Engineering Student Community (SESC), offered students a platform to demonstrate their programming skills and prepare for the global IEEEXtreme 18.0 challenge. With over 65 teams participating, the top 15 advanced to the finals held on October 13 at the SLIIT Malabe Campus. SecQuantum claimed the championship, while Team Rabit and S13 secured the 1st and 2nd Runner-up positions, respectively. CTRLShiftHack and Enigma were also acknowledged for their impressive performances.

SESC played a key role in the event’s success, developed the registration portal and live scoreboard, and managed the coding platform, ensuring a seamless experience for participants. The collaboration between SESC and the IEEE Computer Society of SLIIT was key to creating a well-structured competition. By leveraging SESC’s technical expertise and IEEE’s organizational experience, the partnership delivered a platform that not only challenged participants but also prepared them for global coding challenges like IEEEXtreme.

To support participants, two pre-event sessions were conducted. Mr. Eranga Kodithuwakku shared strategies for tackling complex coding challenges, while Mr. Vishan Jayasinghearachchi introduced students to the fundamentals of competitive programming. These sessions highlighted the organizers’ dedication to enhancing students’ skills and confidence.

The success of SLIITXtreme 3.0 emphasized the value of collaboration between student communities and professional organizations like the IEEE Computer Society of SLIIT. Such partnerships bring together diverse strengths, fostering innovation and creating opportunities for students to grow and excel. Together, SESC and IEEE Computer Society of SLIIT demonstrated how collaborative efforts can empower students, build technical talent, and prepare them for future challenges on both national and global stages
