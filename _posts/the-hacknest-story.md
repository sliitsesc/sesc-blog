Hacknest is not just a community, it is a movement where creativity and dreams entwine, visions bloom, and ideas shine. It is where the spark of collaboration ignites, lifting ideas to new heights and paving the way for a future driven by technology and teamwork.

This vision of collaborative innovation drives everything we do at Hacknest. We bring together curious minds and creative thinkers to explore the exciting world of hackathons. This is not your typical dreary sit and listen community. At its core, Hacknest aims to break the hesitation that often holds students back from participating in hackathons. Many doubt their abilities or perhaps feel intimidated by the challenges, but our mission is to change that narrative. Through mentorship programs and hands on workshops, we help teams gain the confidence that they need to embrace the spirit of hackathons and showcase their unlimited potential.

The Hacknest journey began in September 2024 with its first meetup, where enthusiasts gathered to design and develop portfolio websites from scratch. For two hours, they coded, learned, and helped each other transform their ideas into working websites. The energy and collaboration in that first session showed us that Hacknest would become something truly precious.

Hacknest is open to all SLIIT students, and at Hacknest students become part of a culture that encourage new ideas and tackles real problems. Every session brings fresh challenges and opportunities to grow, whether building new projects or preparing for upcoming hackathons. If you walk into any Hacknest session, you will find students with different coding skills working side by side, some writing their first lines of code, while others build complex projects. This diversity of skill levels creates an environment where everyone learns from each other and develops solutions more innovative than any individual could create alone.

Building on this foundation, Hacknest is now preparing for ‘CodeJam’ our upcoming micro hackathon. This is designed to be beginner friendly. CodeJam will encourage students to take their first step into hackathons in a supportive environment. Here they will experience the thrill of finding solutions, working as teams and discovering just how much they can accomplish in a short period of time.
What makes Hacknest truly unique is the energy when everyone comes together. There is something exciting about being in a room where people are not afraid to share ideas or help each other tackle tough problems. This is a place where taking risks is encouraged.

Don’t settle for being ordinary, to be extraordinary join Hacknest and become part of a movement where creativity collaboration and innovation transform ideas into something truly remarkable.
